##Overview
Data is discussed in a Tableau presentation regarding a bike ride-sharing service, CitiBike. All data is for August of 2019 in New York City. Presentation is intended to be used to convince potential investors to fund an equivalent service in Des Moines. This project was completed as instructed as part of an assignment for a data bootcamp on Tableau.

###Image One: CitiBike Presentation Slide

1. Number of trips: This presents the total number of trips in August 2019.

2. August Peak Hours: This presents the number of trips starting at various hours of the day. The '0' presumably represents 12 a.m. with time continuing until
'23' which represents 11 p.m. Peak times are during the morning commute (7 a.m. to 9 a.m.) and the evening commute (4 p.m. to 7 p.m.). This suggests that a 
primary use of the bikes to transit to and from work. Low use time is between 10 p.m. an 5 a.m., hours when most individuals would be asleep. 

###Image Two: Gender Breakdown of Users

The pie chart breaks down users into male, female, and unknown. The data suggests three times as many users are male as female.

###Image Three: Ride Duration of Trips

This line chart presumably breaks down the number of trips by the ride duration. This is a best guess as no codebook of the data is provided in the process of creating this graphic. It isn't really explained what is being created in a manner that is all that informative in the assignment instructions. If understood correctly the data suggests most trips are less than an hour and very few trips are two or more hours.

###Image Four: Ride Duration of Trips by Gender

This line graph allows the viewer to break down the data of the previous visualization by gender identification (male, female, unknown).

###Image Five: Ride Ending Times

This heat map indicates when users are likely to end their trips by hour and day. A pale orange color indicates few trips ending in that hour while a dark maroon color indicates several trips ending at that time in the day indicated. The data indicates that on weekdays trips end at times that suggest they are being used for commuting to and from work. On weekends there is a more distributed time for trips ending, suggesting that more non-work, possibly recreational, use of the bikes is occurring. The pale orange colors should not be interpreted as indicating ongoing use of the bikes.

###Image Six: Ride Ending Times by Gender

This heat map breaks down the data from the previous image by reported gender of the user. Pattern of use remains consistent between the genders, although males appear to have greater numbers of ending times this reflects the higher proportion of males as users. 

###Image Seven: User Types by Gender and Weekday

This heat map breaks down the two user types (customer, subscriber) by weekday and gender. Subscribers pay a flat fee for ongoing use while customers pay per use. The day suggests that customers show less pattern in suage other than a slight uptick during the weekends while subscribers focus their usage primarily on weekdays, with a slight dip on Wednesdays. This again supports the theory that a large portion of users are using the bike share program as an intentional means to commute to work. Usage by gender does not reveal much variation within the customers but does show some variation within subscribers, with unknown genders having little variation or frequency overall. This likely indicates a greater willingness of subscribers to share personal information, such as gender, with the service sue to an established relationship.
